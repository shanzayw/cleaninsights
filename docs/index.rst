Clean Insights' Python SDK 📏🐍💡
=================================

Privacy-preserving measurement and analytics for Python.

----

`Clean Insights <https://cleaninsights.org/>`_ gives developers a way to plug
into a secure, private measurement platform. It is focused on assisting in
answering key questions about app usage patterns, and not on enabling invasive
surveillance of all user habits. Our approach provides programmatic levers to
pull to cater to specific use cases and privacy needs. It also provides methods
for user interactions that are ultimately empowering instead of alienating.

This Python SDK is part of the wider Clean Insights ecosystem that includes
SDKs in other languages, a consent user interface toolkit and server plugins.
All these tools can be found on the `Clean Insights Developers Page
<https://cleaninsights.org/dev>`_.
